  This program can be used it two ways.
  
  1. Usually it is used to modify some or all of the data on
      on an existing Header Array file.
       In this case, the existing file is not actually
        changed, but a copy of it is made and modified.
       Existing data can be modified and new data (read from
        existing files and/or the terminal) can be added.
  
  2. It can be used to create a new Header Array file from
      scratch. In this case the new data can be read from
      existing files and/or the terminal.
  
  This program is easy to run interactively. It is partly
   command-driven and partly menu-driven. Help is available.
  
  Is this based on an old HEADER ARRAY file?   [Y/n]

  NEW HEADER ARRAY FILE TO BE CREATED
  -----------------------------------
  
  
 mak.har
 (Opened new header file 'mak.har'.)
  
  Available tasks are:
  
  Command               Meaning
     ah            ADD one or more arrays from HEADER array file
     ds            DEFINE SETS for adding arrays from text file
     at            ADD one or more arrays from TEXT file
     da            DELETE one or more ARRAYS from old file
     ra            RESTORE one or more deleted ARRAYS on old file
     mw            MODIFY data from the old file and WRITE it on the new file
     aw            ADD new data and WRITE it on the new file
     ex            EXIT, saving the new header array file
     q             QUIT, without saving the new header array file
     lh            LIST the HEADERS, their status and size of associated arrays
     oh            show ONE HEADER, its status and size of associated array
     ch            CHANGE a HEADER name
     eln           EXAMINE a LONG NAME
     cln           CHANGE the LONG NAME associated with a header

  TEXT FILE CONTAINING THE NEW DATA TO BE ADDED
  ---------------------------------------------
  
  Input the full name (INCLUDING suffix) of this file.
  
  
 mak_modhar.txt
 (Opened, as text, existing file 'mak_modhar.txt'.)
  
  !  (There is no CREATION information on this file.)
  
  From this file, do you wish to add
     [A]      ALL of the data arrays on the file
  
     [s]      Some of the arrays (Process arrays one by one)
                        (XXX to skip, XXQ to exit)
     [n]      NONE of the arrays.
  
  Please enter your choice. ([A] is the default.)

  Coefficient = make_version (time).
  No sets defined for coefficients.
  
  (Read real matrix of size: 10.)
  Longname 'make_version'
  
  Header found on the text file 'M001'.
  
 (Written real array, size 10, header "M001".)
  
  Header 'M001' transferred to the new file.
  Longname 'make_version'
  
  Coefficient = make_rowshr (nind,ncom,time).
  No sets defined for coefficients.
  
  (Read real matrix of size: 36x36x10.)
  Longname 'make_rowshr'
  
  Header found on the text file 'M002'.
  
 (Written real array, size 36x36x10, header "M002".)
  
  Header 'M002' transferred to the new file.
  Longname 'make_rowshr'
  
  Coefficient = make_col (nind,ncom,time).
  No sets defined for coefficients.
  
  (Read real matrix of size: 36x36x10.)
  Longname 'make_col'
  
  Header found on the text file 'M003'.
  
 (Written real array, size 36x36x10, header "M003".)
  
  Header 'M003' transferred to the new file.
  Longname 'make_col'
  Last array on file has been read. Transfer completed.
  TRANSFERRED A TOTAL OF 3 ARRAYS TO THE NEW FILE.

  HISTORY OF THIS RUN OF THE PROGRAM
  
  Type in your name,
    or    -   to ignore any old history,
          =   to take just any old history (no new),
          0   to have no history on the new file.
