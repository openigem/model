  This program can be used it two ways.
  
  1. Usually it is used to modify some or all of the data on
      on an existing Header Array file.
       In this case, the existing file is not actually
        changed, but a copy of it is made and modified.
       Existing data can be modified and new data (read from
        existing files and/or the terminal) can be added.
  
  2. It can be used to create a new Header Array file from
      scratch. In this case the new data can be read from
      existing files and/or the terminal.
  
  This program is easy to run interactively. It is partly
   command-driven and partly menu-driven. Help is available.
  
  Is this based on an old HEADER ARRAY file?   [Y/n]
