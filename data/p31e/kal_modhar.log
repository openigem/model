  This program can be used it two ways.
  
  1. Usually it is used to modify some or all of the data on
      on an existing Header Array file.
       In this case, the existing file is not actually
        changed, but a copy of it is made and modified.
       Existing data can be modified and new data (read from
        existing files and/or the terminal) can be added.
  
  2. It can be used to create a new Header Array file from
      scratch. In this case the new data can be read from
      existing files and/or the terminal.
  
  This program is easy to run interactively. It is partly
   command-driven and partly menu-driven. Help is available.
  
  Is this based on an old HEADER ARRAY file?   [Y/n]

     da            DELETE one or more ARRAYS from old file
     ra            RESTORE one or more deleted ARRAYS on old file
     mw            MODIFY data from the old file and WRITE it on the new file
     aw            ADD new data and WRITE it on the new file
     ex            EXIT, saving the new header array file
     q             QUIT, without saving the new header array file
