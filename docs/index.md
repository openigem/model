# Abstract

OpenIGEM NAICS36 will be an open-source implementation of the IGEM-NAICS general 
equilibrium model of the US economy. IGEM-NAICS itself is an updated version of 
the IGEM model described in _Double Dividend: Environmental Taxes and 
Fiscal Reform in the United States_ by Jorgenson, Goettle, Ho and Wilcoxen 
(MIT Press, 2013). Files in the "IGEM-NAICS" section below are intended to 
accompany the book by describing the principal areas where IGEM-NAICS differs 
from the earlier model. 

The OpenIGEM version of the model is coded using Sym, a language for 
expressing general equilbrium models clearly and concisely. The model is
solved using GEMPACK, a software suite for general equilibrium modeling
produced by the Centre for Policy Studies. Links
to information about Sym and GEMPACK are provided under the "Implementation" 
section below.
