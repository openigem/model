# Project Overview

OpenIGEM NAICS36 will be an open-source implementation of the IGEM-NAICS 
general equilibrium model of the US economy. The project is described in 
detail in its [Technical Work Plan](OpenIGEM_Technical_Work_Plan.pdf). The 
sections below provide additional information on the economic design of
the IGEM-NAICS model and the open source implementation of it, NAICS36. All of the 
files on this site, including data, code and documentation, are 
works in progress and will be revised as project evolves.

# Design of IGEM-NAICS

IGEM-NAICS itself is an updated version of the IGEM model described in 
_Double Dividend: Environmental Taxes and Fiscal Reform in the United 
States_ by Jorgenson, Goettle, Ho and Wilcoxen (MIT Press, 2013). The 
files below are intended to accompany the book by describing the 
principal areas where IGEM-NAICS differs from the earlier model.

+ [Appendix A: Equations and Glossary](AppendixA.pdf)
+ [Appendix B: Accounts for Econometric General Equilibrium Modeling](AppendixB.pdf)

# NAICS36 Implementation

Implementation of NAICS36 is underway and not yet complete. The code and 
data currently available can be found on GitHub at the repository listed 
below. Links are also provided for Sym, the language used for coding the model, 
and GEMPACK, a software suite that will be used for solving it.
