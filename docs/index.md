# Abstract

OpenIGEM NAICS36 will be an open-source implementation of the IGEM-NAICS general 
equilibrium model of the US economy. IGEM-NAICS itself is an updated version of 
the IGEM model described in _Double Dividend: Environmental Taxes and 
Fiscal Reform in the United States_ by Jorgenson, Goettle, Ho and Wilcoxen 
(MIT Press, 2013). The files below are intended to accompany the book by 
describing the principal areas where IGEM-NAICS differs from the earlier model.

Implementation of OpenIGEM is underway and not yet complete. All of the 
files on this site, including data, code and documentation, are works in 
progress and will be revised as project evolves.
